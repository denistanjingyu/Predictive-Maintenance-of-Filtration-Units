# Predictive Maintenance of Filtration Units

Project under Nanyang Technological University URECA undergraduate research programme

Project Title: An Economic Perspective on Predictive Maintenance of Filtration Units
• Investigated the possibility of predictive maintenance of an ultra-filtration unit by adopting machine learning and data analytics to predict the differential pressure
• Applied Industry 4.0 levers such as IoT enabled sensors to enable real-time remote monitoring
• Utilized Monte Carlo simulation to model risk and uncertainty
